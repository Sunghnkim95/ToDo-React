Todosite

A Todo list of tasks to keep track of, as well as, upcoming and continuation of projects needed and wanted to do.
This repo was built to keep a list of task needed to be done within the short or long run. 

This project will have a register/login page for new and existing users to use, as well as, tabs for specific tasks needed such as daily, weekly, projects, completed, and more.

The React framework was implemented for this site and an upcoming backend will keep track of all the user's todos. This project is to help better my understanding of React and its properties, and keep track of projects I would like to work on.
